## Os Sentinelas: Outline

**Chapter 1: The Watch**

**Setting:** The bustling, neon-lit city of Nova Aeterna, a metropolis built around a colossal, ancient tree, the Árbol de la Vida. The city center is protected by a shimmering barrier, rumored to be a manifestation of the Árbol's magic. 

**Protagonist:** Elara, a young woman with a sharp wit and a rebellious streak, is assigned to the Sentinels, a secretive order tasked with protecting Nova Aeterna from unseen threats. Though initially skeptical, Elara is driven by a need to prove herself and make a difference. 

**Conflict:** During Elara's first night on patrol, she experiences a terrifying wave of unease. The city's normally vibrant energy feels muted, replaced by a chilling emptiness. She senses a presence, something hidden, lurking beneath the surface. The other Sentinels, seasoned veterans, dismiss her fear, attributing it to a rookie's nerves. Elara, however, is haunted by the experience.

**Themes:** Duty, skepticism vs. faith, the unknown, the burden of responsibility.

**Conflict:** The "wrongness" intensifies, manifesting as growing darkness in the city’s core, disrupting the flow of magic and draining the Árbol's life force. Elara’s warnings are dismissed by the Sentinels, who remain focused on mundane threats. Isolated and alone, Elara begins to question the true purpose of the Sentinels.

They reveal that the Sentinels have been corrupted, their purpose twisted, and they are actively facilitating the Árbol's weakening.
* **The Corrupted Sentinels:** Elara discovers that the Sentinels have been feeding on the Árbol's energy, their power amplified at the expense of the city's life force. She is forced to question her loyalty and her place within the order.
* **The Ally:** Elara finds an unlikely ally in the street artist she encountered previously. He becomes her guide through the city’s underbelly, offering her knowledge, protection, and a sense of hope. Together they seek a way to restore the Árbol and confront the true source of the threat.

**Chapter 3: The Awakening**
